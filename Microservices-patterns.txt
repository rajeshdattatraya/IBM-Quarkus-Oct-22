Network based Applications - Distributed Application

Application has layers:

1.User interface layer
2.Application biz layer
3.Data Layer /Repository layer


Architecture of Distributed Application

1.Mainframework based distributed
   1.Application biz layer
   2.Data Layer /Repository layer
 Where as User interface layer is kept in dump terminals connected to mainframworks.

Drawbacks:
1.Too costly
2.scalability is too difficult.

Advantage:
1.High security
2.Centeralized management.

2.Client Server Architecture

2.1.Main framework based client -server , where as mainframe acts as server and digital computers act as clients.
 
2.2.Digital computer based client - server architechture
   Servers and clients are digital computers

Based on this we can classify the applications  layered /tiered concept

1.single tier/layer
   client,server,database every is kept in one single machine...
2.two tier/layer
  user interface is kept in client machine,
  data logic and biz logic is kept in server machine
 both machines are connected via networks

          "This arch based on LAN /WAN"

3.three tier /layer

 This arch based on "internet network" and web computing

   client - client machine
   server - biz logic is kept inside another machine
   database - is kept inside another machine

 Client is browser
 Server BIZ logic is kept as "web Applications"
 Database is accessed by "Server side technologies - J2EE,ASP/.net,PHP,....

4.N-tier / layer

 Client is browser
 Server BIZ logic is kept as "web Applications"
   -Again spilt into multi layered
 Database is accessed by "Server side technologies - J2EE,ASP/.net,PHP,....

		    How to build N-tier distributed Applications

Steps/Process:

1.Domain Modeling

  Banking, Online Food Delivery App, Ecommerce Domain

2.Select technology

   if your app is based on web and internet.
  Steps:
   1. Database -  Oracle 
   2. MOM - RabbitMQ,IBM MQ,Microsoft MQ
   3. Development Technology
       Java/JEE  - Why you go with specific implmentation technologies?
       .Net
       Php

3.Development and release methodology
   Waterfall -  traditional dev , release

Any domain consist of various modules
 -Accounts
 -Loans
 -Customers
 -Card
etc.....
 
4.Testing
   Once the development is over, the app is going to be under testing

5.Production
   Once the app is tested fully, ready for production.

6.Maintance
   Once the app in the production, it goes on maintaince...

if any app is built based on the above methodology, which is called as "Monolithic"

.....................................................................................
 Challanges in the application development,testing,relase,Production,maintaince

1.Every thing has to go step by step -  this increase cost , time waste,resource waste

Companies like Amazon,Netflix who wanted fast development,test,release,maintaince : Dynamic  methodology to build applications -  No downtime,
One module takes more time ,another module takes less time, because of one module , other module should not wait.

2.Technology bottleneck - Mono technology
 
 The whole application is built using single technology - Java - vendor lock
 The whole application targets single database - Oracle /Mysql/Microsoft SQL server..


3.Employing security layer is more complicated

4.Deployment / Production.

   The dev and prod env is completly different
   Bare deployment models
   VM based deployment...
...................................................................................
			  New way of building apps


1.Automatation is key concept 

   to anays,dev,test,release,prod,maintaince

Agile :(Requirement Analysis)

  Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments

Breaks the application into smaller and smaller.
 - fast delivery with quality on time.

Requirments are highly dynamic, cant be freezed,since it is dynamic start development,test,release,deploy peridically.

We need automation, through which  automatically only we can achive fast delivery -
 in order to automate, a new technology was created "Dev Ops" - Dev + Operations togther.

Distributed source code repo - git
Pipe lines tools  - 
   Jenkins -(Continuous Integration)

Requirement---> Dev---push the code to source code repo---|CI Tool---Compile--Build/pack--Testing-Deployment(CD)

Every thing is here Continuous happens

Continuous Req Analysis
Continuous Dev 
Continuous release /build
Continuous test
Continuous release /build
Continuous deployment
Continuous tracing and monitoring

This process applied on every module in the applications
OrderManagement 
   Continuous Req Analysis,Dev,release,test,deployment,tracing,monitoring

CustomerManagement 
   Continuous Req Analysis,Dev,release,test,deployment,tracing,monitoring


if any app is built based on the above methodology, that application is called as 				  "MicroService"

	     How to convert existing monolithic apps into microservices
.....................................................................................

There is a process / pattern to convert existing monolithic into microservices
                          "Scale Cube"


Scale cube 3D model defines three separate ways to scale an application.

X-Axis
Z-Axis
Y-Axis

Y-Axis scalling talks about how to spilt the existing monolith  application into micro services based on "functionals aspects" - Service

A Service is a "mini application" that implmements narrowly focused functionality.
Such as orderManagement,customer Management, and so on....

Some services are scalled based on "X-axis" and some services are "Z-scalling".


Your App
   -Y scalling
       -X or Z scalling....

The high level definition of microservices architecture(microservices) is an architectural style that "functionally decomposes an application into set of services(mini applcation)

In Monlolith app the app is broken into "modules" where as microservice break as services(mini application)..

What Microservices offers?

1.Microservices offers "form of modularity"
2.Each service has its own database - Customer Service may use "Mongodb'
  where as payment service may use "Oracle database"

Benefits of the microservice architecture

 It enables the continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications.
 Services are small and easily maintained.
 Services are independently deployable.
 Services are independently scalable.
 The microservice architecture enables teams to be autonomous.
 It allows easy experimenting and adoption of new technologies.
 It has better fault isolation

			How to design and implment microservices

The microservices is all about practices followed,implemented, and tested in real time production grade applications in various companies like amazon,netflix,google,microsoft.

The many community people joined to togther who formed the pattern language in order to begin development of Microservices - Microservice pattern language design patterns

		  Decision Pointers when start building app


Step : 0 - May be for new Application(new Requirement) or existing Application

Requriment for building online food delivery:
	
1.You are developing a server-side enterprise application.

2.It must support a variety of different clients including desktop browsers, mobile browsers and native mobile applications. 

3.The application might also expose an API for 3rd parties to consume.

4.It might also integrate with other applications via either web services or a message broker.

5.The application handles requests (HTTP requests and messages) by executing business logic; accessing a database; exchanging messages with other systems; and returning a HTML/JSON/XML response. 

6.There are logical components corresponding to different functional areas of the application.	

Biz domain :
 Orders 
 Customers
 Delivery
 Restaurnt

			   Software Development and Design patterns

In order to build applications in a standard way across the industry, we follow common design patterns.


The Problem(Requirment)
              ----------->Monolith----|Follows all monolith Design Patterns
Most of GOF pattern and MVC......
	
	     ------------>MicroService----|Follows MicroService Design patterns.

if you pick the Microservices  arch pattern, you must choose numerous other patterns to deal with the consequences of your decision.

Micro Service Arch Patterns:

Problem - level-0
 MicroServices - level-1
	-------->Y'Scaling Pattern - level -2
		    Functional Decomposion Pattern


Decompostion:
 
Decompose by Business capability:

Define services corresponding to business capabilities. A business capability is a concept from business architecture modeling. It is something that a business does in order to generate value. A business capability often corresponds to a business object, e.g.

Order Management is responsible for orders
Customer Management is responsible for customers

Business capabilities are often organized into a multi-level hierarchy. For example, an enterprise application might have top-level categories such as Product/Service development, Product/Service delivery, Demand generation, etc.

Examples
The business capabilities of an online store include:

Product catalog management
Inventory management
Order management
Delivery management

How to indentify business capability?
   You have to master business
 

Alternate Pattern: Decompose by subdomain:

Define services corresponding to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) subdomains. DDD refers to the application’s problem space - the business - as the domain. A domain is consists of multiple subdomains. Each subdomain corresponds to a different part of the business.

Subdomains can be classified as follows:

Core - key differentiator for the business and the most valuable part of the application
Supporting - related to what the business does but not a differentiator. These can be implemented in-house or outsourced.
Generic - not specific to the business and are ideally implemented using off the shelf software

Examples

The subdomains of an online store include:

Product catalog
Inventory management
Order management
Delivery management
…
The corresponding microservice architecture would have services corresponding to each of these subdomains.

Micro Service Arch Patterns:

Problem - level-0
 MicroServices - level-1
	-------->Y'Scaling Pattern - level -2
		    Functional Decomposion Pattern
	-------->Data /Storage Modeling - Level -3


Data /Storage Modeling:
1.Database Per Service Pattern
   
Services are indenpendently built,tested,deployed, so we have to have its own database.
  
Problem - level-0
 MicroServices - level-1
	-------->Y'Scaling Pattern - level -2
		    Functional Decomposion Pattern
	-------->Data /Storage Modeling - Level -3
			Database Per Service Pattern

In large scale Microservices are going to communicate each other, Services are dependent with respect to biz tranactions.

 CustomerService                  OrderService
    |---place order                   |
          
			
 Customer table                   Order table

Incase if you update customer and order table together we need to ensure that update operations are succfully carried out.

Since each service has its own database, how to ensure that services are properly updating data.

                          Data Consistency in microservice 
			     (Distributed transcation)

Problem - level-0
 MicroServices - level-1

			 Saga Pattern - for CURD operations -level 3.1

How to implement distributed Transactions?

Solutions:
1.2PC (2 phase commit)
2.Saga
    Event / Message oriented way of communicating services through which 
 transaction are performed
Types of Saga implementation:
  Choreography based saga
  orchestration based saga

        --------->Service Communication Patterns - 4


Service Communications:

1.Service Communication style patterns
2.Service lookup(Discovery Patterns)
3.Service Reliablity Patterns
4.Service External Communictions -Api GateWays


Services at low level exposed as "API"

API Types/API implmementations:
1.REST
2.RPC
3.GraphQL
4.MOM implmentation
5.SOAP


1.Service Communication style patterns
 Way of communcations:

1.1.RPI - Remote Procedure Invocation:
.................................
 We need to think about protocals
REST - http
RPC(GRpc) - TCP
Apache Thrift
1.2.Message Oriented Pattern
  MOM middlewares
    - Kafka,rabbitmq...


Service Look ups (Service Discovery Patterns)

  Identifying the location of the services in container based deployed is really hard, the reason is dynamic ips.

Service Discovery Implmentations:

1.client side discovery
      Registry implmentation would be the part of who is calling the service
2.Server side discovery
      Registry is maintained in centeralized place , all services who looks up from the common registry

As part of service discovery we can implment, Load balancer or Router, so that we can
"Scalability and High Availabilty"

3.Service Reliablity Patterns:
  
   Service A is calling Service B 
          Service A get results -  success/failure(exception)
 	  Service A get results
		  on time  - 1000ms
		  beyond time - 5000ms
  Service a dont want to wait---hangging..
		Timeout
	
Reliablity pattern helps to resolve "Errors" , convert errors into usefull response.
Reliablity pattern helps to resolve "Slow calls" , incase slow call, we can return alternate response from the caching servers.

Reliablity Pattern Implmentations

1.BulkHead
2.Timeout
3.Retry
4.CircuitBreaker

4.Service External Communictions -Api GateWays
